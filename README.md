# Petsy

Petsy is an e-commerce platform that is inspired by Esty. Petsy makes it easier for venders, creators and small e-commerce businesses to connect with buyers to sell a variety of pet related handcrafted or vintage products related.
The BnB is inspired by AirBnB, an online marketplace that allows users to list and rent out their homes or other properties for short term rent.
